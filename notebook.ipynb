Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?</p>\n<p>Well, we're going to find out! The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. Let's load it in and take a look.</p>","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"deletable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"],"editable":false}},{"execution_count":257,"source":"# Loading in

Repeat laureates\n<p>For most scientists/writers/activists a Nobel Prize would be the crowning achievement of a long career. But for some people, one is just not enough, and there are few that have gotten it more than once. Who are these lucky few? (Having won no Nobel Prize myself, I'll assume it's just about luck.)</p>","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"46"},"deletable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"],"editable":false}},{"execution_count":269,"source":"# Selecting the laureates that have received 2 or more prizes.\nnobel %>%\n    group_by(full_name) %>%\n    count() %>%\n    filter(n != 1)","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"46"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/markdown":"\nfull_name | n | \n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Comit<U+00E9> international de la Croix Rouge (International Committee of the Red Cross) | 3                                                                                        | \n| Frederick Sanger                                                                         | 2                                                                                        | \n| John Bardeen                                                                             | 2                                                                                        | \n| Linus Carl Pauling                                                                       | 2                                                                                        | \n| Marie Curie, n<U+00E9>e Sklodowska                                                       | 2                                                                                        | \n| Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)                      | 2                                                                                        | \n\n\n","text/plain":"  full_name                                                                               \n1 Comit<U+00E9> international de la Croix Rouge (International Committee of the Red Cross)\n2 Frederick Sanger                                                                        \n3 John Bardeen                                                                            \n4 Linus Carl Pauling                                                                      \n5 Marie Curie, n<U+00E9>e Sklodowska                                                      \n6 Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)                     \n  n\n1 3\n2 2\n3 2\n4 2\n5 2\n6 2","text/latex":"\\begin{tabular}{r|ll}\n full\\_name & n\\\\\n\\hline\n\t Comit<U+00E9> international de la Croix Rouge (International Committee of the Red Cross) & 3                                                                                       \\\\\n\t Frederick Sanger                                                                         & 2                                                                                       \\\\\n\t John Bardeen                                                                             & 2                                                                                       \\\\\n\t Linus Carl Pauling                                                                       & 2                                                                                       \\\\\n\t Marie Curie, n<U+00E9>e Sklodowska                                                       & 2                                                                                       \\\\\n\t Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)                      & 2                                                                                       \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n","text/html":"<table>\n<thead><tr><th scope=col>full_name</th><th scope=col>n</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n\t<tr><td>Comit&lt;U+00E9&gt;
